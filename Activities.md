Since March 31, 2023, I have co-founded and co-organized an academic organization called the HKU International Economics Study Group.<br>

Our sessions cover a wide range of topics in international economics and related areas, aiming to foster knowledge exchange and deepen understanding through in-depth discussions.<br>

At each meeting, one of our Ph.D. students presents either recent/classical papers or shares academic techniques. Below is a list of the presentations:<br>
