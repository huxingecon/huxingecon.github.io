## HKU International Economics Study Groups

Since March 31, 2023, I have been co-organizing an academic endeavor named the HKU International Economics Study Group. 
Our sessions are dedicated to a wide array of topics within the field of international economics, with the goal of fostering knowledge exchange and understanding through in-depth discussions. 
At each gathering, one of our students presents a recent theoretical research paper. 
The purpose of this study group is to acquaint our students with the cutting-edge research and to encourage their participation in the scholarly discourse of international economics. 
We aim to inspire innovative thinking and a keen interest in academic research through this engagement.
