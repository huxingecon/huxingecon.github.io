## HKU International Economics Study Groups

Since March 31, 2023, I have been co-organizing an academic endeavor named the HKU International Economics Study Group. <br> 

Our sessions are dedicated to a wide array of topics within the field of international economics, with the goal of fostering knowledge exchange and understanding through in-depth discussions. <br>

At each gathering, one of our Ph.D. students presents a recent/classical theoretical research paper.
